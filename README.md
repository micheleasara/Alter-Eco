# What is Alter Eco?
Alter Eco is an iOS app that combines gamification and automatic computation of a user's carbon footprint to guide towards a more eco-friendly behaviour. By employing custom-made algorithms and natural language processing techniques, Alter Eco is capable of estimating, aggregating and visualizing user's travelling and dietary emissions. This data then acts as the basis for a point system which can be spent to build a 3D virtual forest. Fundamentally, the main purpose of Alter Eco is to simplify the calculation of an individual's carbon footprint by relying on automatic, or semi-automatic, features.  
  
This application was developed initially as part of my group project at Imperial College London in Winter 2020. Later on, I continued it as my individual project. I am currently the sole owner of all intellectual property rights.
# Technical details and where to find more information
This project was written with Swift 5.3, while the user interface is based on the very first version of SwiftUI. In some instances, SwiftUI could not be used directly and instead I relied on UIKit. The main frameworks I used for the backend are instead MapKit, Core ML, Core Data and SceneKit. Finally, to associate a barcode to a food type, I rely on Open Food Facts (https://world.openfoodfacts.org/).  
  
For more information regarding specific algorithms, code architecture, methodology and more, please refer to the PDF file containing the report I wrote for my MSc.
# System requirements
The software requires iOS 13 (or greater), an internet connection and localization permission to work correctly.
# Can I use your code?
As I did not include any license, everything in this repo is under exclusive copyright (https://choosealicense.com/no-permission/). That being said, I am not a very strict person. Giving credit to me and Alter Eco in any derived work that is distributed freely is sufficient, but I do ask you to contact me if you plan on making a commercial product out of anything you see here.
